Please include as much of the following information as possible:

## Disclosure Process

After a vulnerability is reported:

1. The maintainers will acknowledge receipt within **72 hours**
2. The issue will be investigated privately
3. A fix will be prepared and tested
4. A coordinated disclosure will occur once a fix is available

We request that you **do not publicly disclose** the vulnerability until it has been addressed.

We appreciate responsible disclosure and will credit reporters where appropriate.
